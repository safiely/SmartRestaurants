Smart Restaurants
======
SMART Restuarants is an Android Java application that facilates restaurant owners by allowing their customers to order  through a mobile application. Currently the food menu we are using is the In-n-Out menu. The features the mobile application include are the following bluemix services. 

IBM Bluemix Services
======

###### Watson
   * Speech To Text (Complete) We use this service to allow Watson to listen to the customers order. 
   * Text To Speech (Complete) We use this service to allow Watson to repeat the order and total to the customer. 
   * Conversation (Coming Soon) We use this service to have a conversation between the customer and Watson. 
   
###### Data & Analytics
   * NoSql Bluemix Database (Complete) We use this service to send/receive customers order to the database.                          
   
###### Mobile
   * Push Notifications (Coming Soon) We use this service to notify the customer their order is complete.

The approach we took was to split the In-n-Out menu into sub categories. In this case there are only two categories, Main-Menu and Drink-Size.In the Main-Menu the only items it contains are the following: Double-Double, Cheese Burger, Hamburger and Fries. The Drink-Size category only contains the size of the drinks: small, medium, large or x-lg. The reason we did this is because we are able assign a unique ID for the specific instance of interaction between Watson and the User. There is a process to order the food from In-n-Out. We first promt the user with the simple question, "What would you like to order from the Main Menu" we would look for relevent infomartion from the following intent:

In this specific category we have the main-menu as intents. And in each intent we have defined common statements a user may make for example #double-double:


The user may say "I want a double double" or say "I want a number 1".
